# 🚗 Car Accident Detection for CCTV using YOLOv5

This project is focused on training the YOLOv5 model to detect car accidents on the road in real-time. The detected images are captured and sent to users via Line notifications. The program settings can be customized by the user through a standalone program created using PyQt Design.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Car Accident Detection**: Using the YOLOv5 model, the system is trained to detect car accidents on the road in real-time.

2. **Image Capture and Notification**: Once an accident is detected, the system captures the image and sends it to the user via Line notifications.

3. **User Customization**: The program settings can be customized by the user through a standalone program created using PyQt Design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **YOLOv5**: A state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system used for detecting car accidents.

- **PyQt Design**: A set of Python bindings for The Qt Company’s Qt application framework used for creating the standalone program.
